# Opiology #

## What is Opiology? ##

Opiology is a program written for .NET and Mono using C#. Opiology's main goal is to give users a fast, easy-to-use portable tool to help maximize the access to harm reduction techniques and to provide this information without being restrained by the user's availability of the Internet.

## Goals in Detail ##

•To provide thorough information concerning opioids with examples being general information, common dosages, methods of administration, user created reviews and articles about opioids, pharmacokinetic information, opioid syntheses, harm reduction, guides for emergency situations, a library containing pill imprints and pictures of opioid pharmaceuticals, a directory of rehabilitation/opioid maintenance clinics, and an opioid dosage converter.

•To display this information by means of a small, efficient, open-source program (for safety and transparency), which is to be compatible on all platforms.

•To translate the program itself and information files into several languages for non-English-speaking users around the world.

•To make this information easily editable by means of XML.


## Purpose ##
There is a lot of information on the internet concerning opioids. I've found while researching and reading that a good portion of this information is either misleading, hard to follow, or simply wrong. Opiology hopes to create a searchable "compendium" of opioid-related knowledge. The information that the program displays is filtered of any guides or articles that could cause harm of any degree, in any way, and tries to guide the reader down the best path when making decisions in his or her lifestyle.
